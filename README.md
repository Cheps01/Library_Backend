## How to run

In case you haven't installed it yet, run 'npm init' and then 'npm install express'.
Once it's installed, run 'npm index.js' as you'll see a message in the terminal of the app
running. Go to a browser and check the app in localhost:3000. From there you can see the 
responses of the API according to the request.
